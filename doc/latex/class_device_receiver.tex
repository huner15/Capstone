\subsection{Detailed Description}
A \hyperlink{class_device_receiver}{Device\+Receiver} is an abstract representation of an aircraft surveillance device data report receiver. Surveillance device data is expected to received on separate T\+C\+P/\+I\+P network ports and this abstract receiver is designed to exist in it\textquotesingle{}s own thread. Receiving behavior is dependent on te behavior of \hyperlink{class_device_receiver_ac60e55ea6cbd0df590204336b50ce7eb}{Receive\+Report()} for a specific device type.
