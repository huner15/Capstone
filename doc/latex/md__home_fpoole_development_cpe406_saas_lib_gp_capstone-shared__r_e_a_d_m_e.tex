\subparagraph*{Goals of this project}

The ultimate purpose of this repository is to define a common test format, so each team can swap out their correlation module, test server module, and C\+D\+T\+I module with another team. This goal should be realized by the end of capstone. However, it\textquotesingle{}s not a requirement of the vertical prototype.

\subparagraph*{Ground Rules}

You are free to make changes on a fork of this project and make local changes, but please do not commit to master without notifying and discussing your changes with the teams.

\subparagraph*{Description of Connection}

The protocols in this repository should be used over a T\+C\+P socket. When sending data, the following standard should be used\+:

``` \mbox{[} length $\vert$ Google protocol Buffer \mbox{]} 4 Bytes n Bytes

```

When reading from a T\+C\+P socket, read the first four bites to recieve the length (in bytes) of the Google protobuffer. Buffer length should be consistant for most of the R\+A\+D\+A\+R, T\+C\+A\+S, A\+D\+S-\/\+B, and Ownship data, but will not be consistant for the C\+D\+T\+I display.

The Following Protocols are specified in the respositry\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item T\+C\+A\+S\+: (tcas.\+proto)
\item A\+D\+S-\/\+B\+: (adsb.\+proto)
\item R\+A\+D\+A\+R\+: (radar.\+proto)
\item Ownship\+: (ownshp.\+proto)
\item C\+D\+T\+I\+: (cdti.\+proto)
\end{DoxyItemize}
